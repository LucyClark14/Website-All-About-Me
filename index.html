	<p>I am a person. I have no life. I like cats. Cats - Munchkin, Siamese, Shorthair, Sphynx, etc. I like Pusheen the Cat. I spend my free time being lazy and procrastinating. I do not like school, work is boring and I do not like homework. I have no hobbies, except reading. I like to read books. Books, I like fantasy and crime books. I enjoy reading books about murder and death. I watch a lot of tv series and movies on fantasy or supernatural or crime topics. I hate writing about myself.</p>

	<p>She is a person. She has no life, and barely any friends. She likes art, she likes cats and she does not like homework. She spends her free time being lazy and procrastinating on her homework and assignments. Tomorrow we have a multimedia exam and she thinks that she is definitely going to fail it. Also, her throat keeps on randomly burning and she doesn't know why.</p>
